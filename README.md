# SeedTheNode

**Decentralized music distribution infrastructure for artist sovereignty**

Artists own their nodes. Music seeds the network. No platforms, no middlemen.

## What is SeedTheNode?

SeedTheNode is open-source infrastructure that enables artists to:
- Own their complete music distribution network
- Preserve their creative process (versions, voice notes, context)
- Distribute via P2P (IPFS) with cryptographic verification
- Receive instant payments via Lightning Network
- Maintain complete sovereignty over their work

## Core Technology

- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 5 + NVMe storage
- **Distribution:** IPFS (decentralized file sharing)
- **Payments:** Bitcoin Lightning Network
- **Provenance:** Cryptographic chain of creative versions
- **Interface:** iOS app + web dashboard

## Status

🚧 **Pre-MVP Development** - Building foundation (February 2026)

## Philosophy

This is infrastructure for artists who reject platform commodification of their creative work. 

- One-time hardware purchase (not subscriptions)
- Local-first architecture (artists own their data)
- Open source (GPL v3)
- Community-funded access model
- Can't be acquired or shut down
